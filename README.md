## Introduction

A timed maths game desgined using HTML, SCSS, CSS and Javascript, implemented with a class using a mobile-first approach.

The game starts off on the home screen where you will be asked to select a level and a time. Once you have selected one from each option, pressing the start button will take you to the game screen. Don't worry though, the timer will only start when you press the enter key in the input box. So you will have plenty of time to grab a cuppa or do some finger exercises 🖐🏃‍♂. You will only have three lives but if you accidently press the enter key without an input then no lives will be deducted 😃. Through the power of sessionStorage, you will see your high score for each combination of level and time next to the current score, just to give you some extra motivation. If you are feeling extra confident, I have displayed my high score with a progress bar to let you know how close you are to beating it. Although I wouldn't count on that happening 😉.
